# Anubis-Game

The story begins with an archaeologist that aspires to demystify the wonders of the ancient Egyptian great civilization. However, something is blocking his way to do so. A weird repulsive power pushes him away. On one of his excavation trips, he found a liquid buried with the death's God tomb, Anubis. Our hero was curious and took that liquid thing to his house to analyses it further. After testing the liquid, he couldn't match its basic forming elements to any of the known on the periodic table so things got even more interesting for him. So he took a sip! And the journey begins.......
